# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#items = []
#(1..10).each do |n|
 #items[n-1] = Item.create(:title => "title#{n}",
 #:description => "description#{n}",
 #:price => "price#{n}",:image_url => "image_url#{n}",)
#end
